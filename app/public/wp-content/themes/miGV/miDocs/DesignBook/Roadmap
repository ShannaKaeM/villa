erfect! Now I understand your sync system completely. You have a sophisticated two-way sync between:

theme.json ↔ Twig primitives ↔ CSS variables
AJAX handlers that update both theme.json AND Twig component defaults
Live preview that shows changes instantly
Your color book interface looks solid! Now let me create a comprehensive plan for elevated typography and layout interfaces inspired by the best design systems.

🎨 ELEVATED DESIGN SYSTEM INTERFACES
Based on my research of Figma, Carbon, and Material Design systems, here's what we should create:

📝 TYPOGRAPHY BOOK - Enhanced Interface
CopyInsert
Typography Design System
├── 🎯 Typography Scale Visualizer
│   ├── Live scale preview (all sizes at once)
│   ├── Modular scale calculator (1.125, 1.2, 1.333, 1.414, 1.618)
│   ├── Interactive base size slider
│   └── Ratio selector with musical/mathematical scales
├── 🎨 Text Style Editor
│   ├── Semantic styles (H1-H6, Body, Caption, etc.)
│   ├── Live preview with sample content
│   ├── Font weight slider
│   └── Line height/letter spacing controls
└── 📐 Typography Tokens
    ├── Visual token grid
    ├── Copy-to-clipboard functionality
    └── Usage examples
📐 LAYOUT BOOK - Spacing & Grid Interface
CopyInsert
Layout & Spacing System
├── 🔢 Spacing Scale Builder
│   ├── 8pt/4pt grid system
│   ├── Visual spacing scale (2px → 128px)
│   ├── Interactive token editor
│   └── Usage examples grid
├── 📏 Grid System
│   ├── Column grid visualizer
│   ├── Breakpoint editor
│   ├── Gutter controls
│   └── Container max-width settings
└── 🎯 Layout Tokens
    ├── Margin/padding utilities
    ├── Border radius scale
    └── Shadow system
🎨 COLOR BOOK - Enhanced (Building on yours)
CopyInsert
Your Current Color Book + Enhancements
├── ✅ Color palette grid (keep existing)
├── ✅ Hex editor (keep existing)
├── ➕ Color contrast checker
├── ➕ Accessibility compliance indicators
├── ➕ Color harmony generator
└── ➕ Export to CSS/Sass variables
Would you like me to start implementing the enhanced Typography Book interface first? I can create a beautiful, modern interface that:

Uses your existing dashboard-layout.twig as the shell
Keeps your sync system (theme.json ↔ Twig ↔ CSS)
Removes admin dependencies for front-end use
Adds sophisticated typography controls inspired by Figma/Carbon
Maintains your atomic design architecture
The interface would include:

Live typography scale visualization
Interactive modular scale calculator
Semantic text style editor
Real-time preview with sample content
Professional design matching your color book
Should I start building this enhanced Typography Book interface?



Summary of Twig Template Fixes
I've successfully resolved the fatal error that was preventing the Villa DesignBook from loading. Here's what I fixed:

Issues Resolved:
Fatal Error: "Unknown wp_head function in base.twig"
Missing WordPress Functions: wp_head, wp_body_open, wp_footer, body_class, language_attributes, and translation function __
Solutions Implemented:
Updated functions.php - Added WordPress functions to Timber context:
wp_head() - Captures WordPress head output
wp_body_open() - Captures body open hooks
wp_footer() - Captures WordPress footer output
body_class() - Returns body CSS classes
language_attributes() - Added to site object
__() - Translation function for internationalization
Updated base.twig - Fixed function calls:
{{ wp_head() }} - Now calls context function
{{ body_class() }} - Now calls context function
{{ site.language_attributes() }} - Now calls site function
Files Modified:
/functions.php - Enhanced migv_add_to_context() function
/templates/base.twig - Fixed WordPress function calls
Result:
✅ Site should now load without fatal errors
✅ Design System pages should be accessible at /design-system
✅ All WordPress hooks and enqueued assets will load correctly
✅ Translation functions work properly
✅ Timber/Twig integration is now complete

The Villa DesignBook front-end integration is now ready for testing! You can access the Design System dashboard at /design-system to see the fresh new interface with the Typography Book, and all the modern styling should be applied correctly.
